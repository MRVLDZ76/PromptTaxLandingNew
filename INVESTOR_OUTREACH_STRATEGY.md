# Prompt Tax - Investor Outreach Strategy & Templates
## 🚨 LEGAL DISCLAIMER & COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK

**CRITICAL: READ BEFORE ANY OUTREACH**

### Legal Requirements for Fundraising

#### 1. **Securities Law Compliance**
Your offering may be considered a **security** under U.S. law (SEC regulations) and requires:

- **Regulation D (506b or 506c) Filing** - Most common for private placements
  - 506(b): Can raise unlimited capital from accredited investors + up to 35 sophisticated investors
  - 506(c): Can publicly advertise BUT only to verified accredited investors
  - File Form D with SEC within 15 days of first sale

- **Regulation CF (Crowdfunding)** - If raising under $5M/year
  - Must use registered crowdfunding platform (Wefunder, Republic, StartEngine)
  - Can advertise publicly
  - Less restrictions but platform fees apply

- **Regulation A+** - If raising between $5M-$75M
  - "Mini-IPO" with SEC qualification
  - Can advertise publicly
  - More expensive but allows non-accredited investors

#### 2. **Accredited Investor Verification**
If using 506(c), you MUST verify:
- Annual income $200K+ ($300K+ joint) for past 2 years
- Net worth $1M+ (excluding primary residence)
- Licensed Series 7, 65, or 82 holder
- Entity with $5M+ in assets

#### 3. **State "Blue Sky" Laws**
- Must comply with state securities laws
- Some states require additional registration
- 506(b) and 506(c) are typically exempt

#### 4. **Anti-Fraud Provisions**
Even if exempt from registration, you MUST:
- ✅ Provide accurate, complete information
- ✅ No misleading statements or omissions
- ✅ Disclose all material risks
- ✅ Provide financial statements

### ⚠️ HIGH-RISK RED FLAGS TO AVOID

**NEVER Promise or Imply:**
- ❌ "Guaranteed returns"
- ❌ "Risk-free investment"
- ❌ "100% ROI in 3 months"
- ❌ Specific return percentages without disclaimers
- ❌ "Can't lose" or similar language

**Instead Use:**
- ✅ "Projected returns based on models"
- ✅ "Historical performance indicates"
- ✅ "Target metrics subject to market conditions"
- ✅ Always include risk disclosures

## 📊 RECOMMENDED FUNDRAISING APPROACH

### Option 1: **Revenue-Based Financing (SAFEST)**
**What It Is:** Investors provide capital in exchange for % of future revenue until they receive X multiple back.

**Advantages:**
- Not technically a "security" in most cases
- No equity dilution
- Easier compliance
- Aligns investor returns with your success

**Terms Example:**
- Investment: $50,000
- Revenue Share: 5% of monthly revenue
- Cap: 1.5x-2.0x return ($75K-$100K total)
- Term: Until cap reached or 36 months

**Platform:** Clearco, Lighter Capital, Pipe

### Option 2: **Marketing Spend Partnership**
**What It Is:** Investor funds ads directly, gets % of revenue from those campaigns.

**Advantages:**
- Clear attribution
- Lower regulatory risk
- Performance-based

**Structure:**
- Investor provides $X for specific ad campaigns
- You provide platform, operations, fulfillment
- Revenue split: 60/40 or 70/30 (company/investor)
- Track via unique UTM codes or promo codes

### Option 3: **506(c) Private Placement**
**What It Is:** Traditional equity or convertible note raise with verified accredited investors.

**Requirements:**
- Attorney to draft PPM (Private Placement Memorandum)
- Form D filing with SEC
- Accredited investor verification
- Cost: $10K-$30K legal fees

**Good For:**
- Raising $250K+
- Professional investors (angels, VCs)

## 🎯 INVESTOR QUALIFICATION QUESTIONS

**Before spending time, ask:**

5. "What due diligence materials do you need?"
6. "Are you the decision-maker, or do you need partner approval?"
7. "What's your expected timeframe to close?"

❌ Wants unrealistic terms (5x return in 30 days)
❌ Asks to manage/control operations
❌ No experience in SaaS, fintech, or performance marketing
❌ Wants to "test" with small amount ($5K-$10K) - not worth legal/admin costs
