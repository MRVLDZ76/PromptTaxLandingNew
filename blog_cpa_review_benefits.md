- ❌ Delayed refunds (8-12 weeks or more)
- ❌ IRS audits and penalties
- ❌ Missed deductions costing $500-$5,000+
- ❌ Incorrect tax liability calculations
- ❌ Payment plans you could have avoided

The good news? **90% of these errors are preventable** with proper review before filing.

At Prompt Tax, we've built an AI-powered platform that guides you through your tax return, then pairs you with licensed CPAs who catch errors before they become costly problems.

## The 7 Most Common (and Expensive) Tax Filing Errors

### 1. **Cryptocurrency Transaction Reporting Mistakes**

**The Error:** With crypto becoming mainstream, many taxpayers forget to report:
- Trading between cryptocurrencies (taxable events)
- NFT sales and purchases
- DeFi staking rewards
- Airdrops and crypto income

**The Cost:** Underreporting crypto can trigger audits and penalties of 20-40% of unreported amounts, plus interest.

**How Prompt Tax Helps:** Our platform automatically imports and categorizes crypto transactions from major exchanges. Our CPAs review every transaction for proper reporting, ensuring you're compliant without overpaying.

---

### 2. **K-1 Form Reporting Errors**

**The Error:** If you're a partner in a business, LLC member, or S-corp shareholder, K-1 forms are notoriously complex:
- Incorrect basis calculations
- Missing passive activity limitations
- Multi-state allocation errors
- Self-employment tax miscalculations

**The Cost:** K-1 errors can result in $2,000-$10,000+ in additional tax liability or IRS notices.

**How Prompt Tax Helps:** Our **Standard Review** includes up to 2 K-1 forms, while **Premium and Complex** plans handle 5+ K-1s with expert CPA analysis of basis, state allocations, and passive activity rules.

---

### 3. **Missing Quarterly Estimated Tax Payments**

**The Error:** Freelancers, gig workers, and self-employed individuals often forget to make quarterly estimated payments, leading to:
- Underpayment penalties (typically 5-8% annually)
- Large tax bills at filing time
- Cash flow problems

**The Cost:** $500-$3,000+ in penalties for many taxpayers.

**How Prompt Tax Helps:** During your CPA consultation (included in Premium and Complex plans), we calculate your estimated tax obligations and set up a payment schedule to avoid penalties.

---

### 4. **Incorrect Filing Status**

**The Error:** Choosing "Single" vs. "Head of Household" vs. "Married Filing Separately" can swing your tax bill by thousands.

**The Cost:** Filing with the wrong status can cost $1,500-$4,000 in lost deductions and higher tax rates.

**How Prompt Tax Helps:** Our AI-guided interview asks the right questions, and our CPAs verify you're using the most tax-advantaged filing status.

---

### 5. **Home Office Deduction Miscalculations**

**The Error:** Remote workers often:
- Claim spaces not exclusively used for business
- Calculate square footage incorrectly
- Miss eligible expenses (utilities, internet, repairs)
- Claim too much (triggering audit flags)

**The Cost:** Over-claiming can trigger audits; under-claiming leaves $500-$2,500 on the table annually.

**How Prompt Tax Helps:** Our platform walks you through proper home office documentation, and CPAs validate your calculations against IRS safe harbors.

---

### 6. **Rental Property Income & Expense Errors**

**The Error:** Real estate investors frequently:
- Miss depreciation deductions
- Incorrectly categorize repairs vs. improvements
- Fail to track basis for multiple properties
- Misapply passive activity loss rules

**The Cost:** $3,000-$8,000+ in missed deductions per property annually.

**How Prompt Tax Helps:** Our **Complex Return + White Glove** package includes unlimited rental property review with strategic depreciation analysis and multi-property basis tracking.

---

### 7. **Math Errors and Data Entry Mistakes**

**The Error:** Simple typos, transposed numbers, or calculation mistakes are the #1 reason for IRS notices.

**The Cost:** Delayed refunds, correction letters, and potential penalties if errors favor the taxpayer.

**How Prompt Tax Helps:** Our AI validates calculations in real-time, and every return gets human CPA review before filing to catch any remaining errors.
