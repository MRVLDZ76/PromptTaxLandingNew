## The Crypto Tax Problem: Why 2025 Is Different

The IRS has made it clear: **cryptocurrency is property, and every trade, sale, swap, or conversion is a taxable event.**

In 2025, the IRS is:
- ✅ Receiving transaction data directly from exchanges (via Form 1099-DA)
- ✅ Cross-referencing blockchain data with tax returns
- ✅ Sending notices to taxpayers with unreported crypto
- ✅ Imposing penalties up to 40% for underreporting

**Translation:** The days of "crypto tax gray area" are over.

But here's the good news: **Prompt Tax automates 95% of crypto tax reporting**, turning what used to take weeks into a 20-minute process with full CPA review.

---

## Why Crypto Taxes Are So Complex (And How We Solve It)

### ❌ The Problem with Traditional Tax Software

**TurboTax, H&R Block, and others:**
- Limited exchange integrations (10-20 exchanges)
- No DeFi support (Uniswap, Aave, Compound)
- Manual NFT entry required
- No staking/airdrops tracking
- Cost basis calculations often wrong
- Extra fees for crypto module ($200-$400)

**Result:** Hours of manual CSV imports, Excel formulas, and crossed fingers hoping the IRS doesn't notice.

## The 5 Biggest Crypto Tax Mistakes (That Cost Taxpayers Thousands)

### 1. **Not Reporting Crypto-to-Crypto Trades**

**The Mistake:** Many taxpayers think only crypto-to-USD sales are taxable.

**The Reality:** Trading Bitcoin for Ethereum, swapping tokens on Uniswap, or converting USDC to DAI are ALL taxable events.

**Example:**
- Buy 1 BTC at $30,000
- Trade for 15 ETH when BTC is $60,000
- **Taxable gain: $30,000** (even though you never cashed out to USD)

**How Prompt Tax Helps:** Our platform automatically tracks every swap, trade, and conversion across all exchanges and wallets, calculating gains/losses on each transaction.

**Potential IRS Penalty Without Reporting:** $6,000-$12,000 (20-40% of unreported gain)

---

### 2. **Missing NFT Sales and Royalties**

**The Mistake:** Not reporting NFT profits because "it's just digital art."

**The Reality:** 
- NFT sales are capital gains
- Creator royalties are ordinary income
- Minting NFTs establishes cost basis
- Gas fees are part of cost basis

**Example:**
- Mint NFT for 0.05 ETH ($100) + $50 gas
- Sell for 2 ETH ($4,000)
- **Taxable gain: $3,850**

**How Prompt Tax Helps:** Direct OpenSea integration imports all sales, purchases, and royalty income. We track gas fees automatically and calculate cost basis including all fees.

**Potential IRS Penalty Without Reporting:** Up to $1,540 (40% of unreported gain)

---

### 3. **Incorrect Cost Basis from Lost Records**

**The Mistake:** "I bought Bitcoin in 2017 but don't remember the price."

**The Reality:** Without cost basis records, the IRS may assume $0 cost basis, meaning 100% of your proceeds are taxable.

**Example:**
- Sell 2 BTC for $120,000 in 2024
- Lost records from 2017 purchase (~$10,000 cost basis)
- **With records:** $110,000 taxable gain
- **Without records:** $120,000 taxable gain
- **Extra tax:** $2,200+ in unnecessary taxes

**How Prompt Tax Helps:** Our blockchain analysis reconstructs transaction history even if you've lost records. We search public blockchain data and cross-reference exchange records going back to 2011.

---

### 4. **Not Tracking Staking, Mining, or Airdrop Income**

**The Mistake:** Thinking staking rewards and airdrops aren't taxable until you sell.

**The Reality:** Staking rewards, mining income, and airdrops are taxed as ORDINARY INCOME when received, then as capital gains when sold.

**Example:**
- Stake 10 ETH, earn 0.5 ETH in rewards (~$1,000)
- Later sell that 0.5 ETH for $1,200
- **Ordinary income at receipt:** $1,000
- **Capital gain at sale:** $200
- **Total tax owed:** ~$350-$450

**How Prompt Tax Helps:** We track the date and fair market value of every staking reward, airdrop, and mining payment, properly categorizing as income and establishing cost basis for future sales.

---

### 5. **Failing to Use Tax-Loss Harvesting**

**The Mistake:** Not offsetting gains with losses from down market periods.

**The Reality:** Crypto losses can offset gains dollar-for-dollar, and up to $3,000 of excess losses can offset ordinary income.

**Example:**
- $50,000 gain on Bitcoin sale
- $30,000 loss on altcoin portfolio
- **Net taxable gain:** $20,000 (saves ~$6,600 in taxes)

**How Prompt Tax Helps:** Our AI identifies unrealized losses in your portfolio and suggests strategic sales to maximize tax benefits while maintaining your investment position (wash sale rules don't apply to crypto yet).

**Tax Savings:** $3,000-$10,000+ for active traders

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Do I need to report crypto if I only bought and held?

**A:** If you only purchased crypto and held it (no sales, swaps, or trades), you don't need to report transactions. However, you must check "YES" on Form 1040 Question 1 about digital assets. We help you answer this correctly.

---

### Q: What if I've never reported crypto taxes before?

**A:** Not uncommon! Our CPAs can help you file amended returns for prior years (2021-2023) to get compliant. The sooner you address it, the better. Elite plan includes multi-year catch-up support.

---

### Q: Can you handle exchanges that don't have API access?

**A:** Yes! CSV upload works for any exchange. We also have blockchain scanning for non-custodial wallets. If an exchange is shut down, we can often reconstruct transactions from blockchain data.

---

### Q: What about crypto I lost or sent to a wrong address?

**A:** Lost or stolen crypto may be deductible in certain circumstances. Our CPAs evaluate your situation during the review. You'll need documentation (police reports, wallet addresses, transaction IDs).

---

### Q: Do wash sale rules apply to crypto?

**A:** Currently NO. Unlike stocks, crypto is exempt from wash sale rules (as of 2024). This means you can sell Bitcoin at a loss and buy it back the same day to harvest tax losses. Our AI identifies these opportunities.

**Warning:** Congress is considering applying wash sale rules to crypto in the future. Take advantage while you can!

---

### Q: Can I deduct NFT losses?

**A:** Yes, if you sold NFTs at a loss, they're capital losses that offset other gains. However, if an NFT drops to zero and you never sold it, it's generally not deductible (unlike securities). Our CPAs guide you on proper treatment.

---

### Q: What if I mined or staked crypto in a pool?

**A:** Pool mining and staking are handled automatically. We calculate your share of rewards based on pool payouts and establish proper cost basis. For mining, we can also help you deduct equipment and electricity on Schedule C.

---

### Q: How do you handle DeFi? It's so complicated!

**A:** Our platform automatically:
- Tracks liquidity pool deposits/withdrawals
- Calculates impermanent loss
- Reports yield farming income
- Handles wrapped tokens (WETH, wBTC)
- Tracks lending/borrowing on Aave, Compound
- Reports governance token rewards

You don't need to understand the technical details – we handle it.

---

### Q: What's your security like? I'm giving you access to financial data.

**A:** 
- ✅ Read-only API keys (we can never trade or withdraw)
- ✅ 256-bit bank-level encryption
- ✅ SOC 2 Type II certified
- ✅ Zero-knowledge architecture (data encrypted before storage)
- ✅ 2FA required for all accounts
